# Zoopla front-end challenge

Using your own choice of tools we would like you to create a simple front-end application that will enable estate agents to manage property listings.

An agent should be able to do the following:

* View all listings
* Mark an individual listing as expired
* Easily distinguish between active and expired listings

A listing contains the following information:

* Image
* Number of bedrooms
* Address
* Postcode
* Description
* Asking price
* Status - `active` or `expired`

Taking advantage of the advances in technology and industry standards, create a simple application that can perform the tasks outlined above. 

Below is visual design of the listings card to illustrate what an individual listing could look like. This image is only there to give a flavour of what it should look like and not a specific design to implement. Anything not present in the specification does not need to be implemented and, where there is any ambiguity, the specification above takes precedence.

Although responsive layouts are not present in this visual, feel free to build them in a way that you think would be valuable to a user.

## Data handling

For the purposes of this challenge use what you prefer for tactically storing the information (session storage, file storage, database). However, please state your preferred solution if you were to implement a full solution.

We recommend you use a tool like [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to mock the data, rather than build out any APIs. If you use JSON Server, please ensure it installed as a local dependency and not globally, as recommended in the installation instructions. The project should build and run successfully after installing the project's local dependencies.

## Technical Notes

You should also ask yourself the following questions before submitting the test, this is what we value and will mark you on:

* Is the code easy to maintain?
* Does the proposed solution scale if more teams were to contribute?
* How difficult is it to onboard another engineer to the codebase?
* Does the application work across different screen sizes?
* Is the logic well tested?
* Is the application accessible to all users?
* Is the code semantic?

Feel free to make and state assumptions on any details not covered in the challenge.

We're not expecting a fully functional solution, we recommend spending **2 - 4 hours**.

## Follow-up discussions 

In the follow-up technical interview we will discuss the solution you have submitted. Think about how you would automate the deployment (what should be built into the pipeline) or what infrastructure you would chose to support your application.

**Good luck!**
